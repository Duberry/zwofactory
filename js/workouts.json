This series of workouts have been curated by 4-time champion Annika Langvad. These workouts are tailored specifically for mountain bikers and will tackle areas of fitness that will dramatically aid you out on the trails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese workouts are designed to be done over a 6-8 week period (2-3 workouts per week) and supplemented with technical mountain biking outdoors if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Denmark Annika often uses an indoor trainer and Zwift to give her an extra edge and get the most out of the time available to train. Her knowledge and expertise will be invaluable in your training during this series.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis first workout of sixteen is a relatively easy start to break you in, with a focus on building endurance. Three blocks of increasing intensity until you have just reached Z4. This is the intensity you'll be riding much of Absa Cape Epic at... but for a whole week.","author":"Annika Langvad","tags":[],"segments":[{"t":"r","p1":44,"d1":360,"p2":65,"textEvents":[{"id":"z2602c573-fb60-41e6-9916-d2355646490a","text":"Welcome to the Absa Cape Epic Workout Series","offset":5},{"id":"z3a9c126a-be24-441c-9e22-8070e4273676","text":"This series of workouts have been curated by 4 time champion Annika Langvad","offset":16},{"id":"z63fe9a29-eed0-4d7b-b6d4-bdf95d22ba0c","text":"These workouts are tailored specifically to help you train for a hardcore MTB event like the Absa Cape Epic","offset":38},{"id":"za242c6df-3f8f-481b-afea-225407028206","text":"An easy start to get us warmed up","offset":60},{"id":"zc93861b2-dfcf-4ea8-a8f2-2a57f2c43646","text":"Then we'll move on to some endurance intervals","offset":71},{"id":"z3e8fd12e-d4ce-465e-9ea1-48e41c464d5e","text":"The Absa Cape Epic is full obstacles that will challenge your fitness","offset":100},{"id":"z530f2826-8e05-47b7-95c0-5f97600ca507","text":"These challenges are different to road cycling","offset":111},{"id":"ze7b068f3-4fa3-4399-be7b-94c4c201d7b5","text":"So we must prepare differently","offset":122},{"id":"zd907f1d6-51a0-4851-ab35-4bab052dfb0b","text":"Each of these workouts are designed to help you tackle these challenges effectively","offset":133},{"id":"z0ac5f690-6fbe-4925-83e2-d3acd7168a1d","text":"Today we have 3 blocks of increasing intensity peaking in Z4","offset":200},{"id":"zd3a43e62-2e76-4a18-b807-4a555751bafc","text":"This is to start improving our endurance","offset":211},{"id":"z18642205-570d-42f3-a6b9-803516eadbb8","text":"And will give you a great foundation for the rest of the series","offset":222},{"id":"z56b7391c-51bf-4b88-b483-866689fe8430","text":"Today's workout is the instensity you'll ride most of the Absa Cape Epic at","offset":233},{"id":"z7343ba4c-922c-4d90-bd7b-57894c601c2a","text":"All warmed up?","offset":340},{"id":"za4d9232c-814a-4052-95dd-3cb0108233a2","text":"Let's get started on section 1","offset":351}]},{"t":"s","p1":65,"d1":300,"textEvents":[{"id":"zdd139ef4-686d-4d82-8734-fe86d8236e3b","text":"Easy start then We'll slowly ramp up","offset":10}]},{"t":"s","p1":76,"d1":240,"textEvents":[]},{"t":"s","p1":87,"d1":180,"textEvents":[{"id":"z7f6a47e1-2e96-47e9-90ea-6688da201700","text":"A quick 2 minutes in Zone 4","offset":160}]},{"t":"s","p1":100,"d1":120,"textEvents":[]},{"t":"s","p1":50,"d1":300,"textEvents":[{"id":"z14ef56a6-f0d9-4d75-a897-d33b5c38fea1","text":"Great effort.

Starting out with a longer work period in Z3 and introducing Z5 intensity in two following sets of increasing intensity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose is to maintain the endurance you've built and start working on improving lactate tolerance and VO2max. This also replicates a tough uphill stint, in and out of the saddle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor me it's often also a mental thing getting used to working at higher intensity.

Teaching your body to be able to deal with lactate after such efforts and continue at a steady state is vital to getting through stages as fast a possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe workout is focused on Z4 interspersed with 30 sec sprints. This type of workout is where it starts to get uncomfortable for me but it helps to keep the eye on the prize.

This is to give the session a strength endurance focus - ensuring we get used to producing not only high power, but also high crank torque, to support us in those sections of a mountain bike race where we have to momentarily freewheel, and are asked to produce huge crank torque from 0rpm!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe stimulate acidosis during the 'over' efforts, and we are then trying to recover, while still producing a moderate effort during the 'under' phase. Think of the 'over' as a technical part of a climb, while the under is climbing on a fire road or through a field!","author":"Annika Langvad","tags":[],"segments":[{"t":"r","p1":44,"d1":420,"p2":75,"textEvents":[{"id":"zb61771dc-3696-4f30-92e5-218e0d862acb","text":"Welcome to the Absa Cape Epic Workout Series - this is workout 12!","offset":10},{"id":"z20260527-66b0-478b-a61d-f93ff1487e38","text":"Today's session is a strength endurance focused session, where we repeatedly tip over and dip under our threshold, at 70rpm.","offset":25},{"id":"zdee5e40d-b1c5-465a-9205-002a9ff1cdf8","text":"As has now become our standard warm up, we start with a progressive ramp before going in to some 30second activation efforts to get us ready for the session.","offset":43},{"id":"ze0953e77-f31c-409b-a3d6-4685384ef400","text":"A progressive ramp followed by some sprints ticks all the boxes for a warm up and will leave you ready to get the most out of efforts in this session","offset":51},{"id":"zf532f0e7-baa9-4083-bd82-3161d4715fff","text":"The Absa Cape Epic, being a long distance event coupled with some tricky terrain will require a lot of strength and good endurance.","offset":101},{"id":"z5d67e112-931f-4464-ad74-e75aa6611298","text":"Strength and endurance - two attributes which we are developing today.","offset":11},{"id":"zbe915658-6c4f-4b37-b3be-238987017161","text":"Strength is fundamental in mountain biking to be able to cope with sections where you have to produce huge crank torque from a very low cadence as you stall on a technical section.","offset":188},{"id":"z9bb593c2-049d-469f-b7e3-ad1d17202371","text":"You should be feeling pretty warmed up now.
